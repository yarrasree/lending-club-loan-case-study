# Lending-club-loan-case-study
Goals of data analysis:
Credit risk is something peer-to-peer (P2P) lending investors must carefully consider when making informed investment decisions; it is the risk of default as a result of borrowers failing to make required payments, leading to loss of principal and interest.In this project, we build predicting modelhistorical loan data that help investors quantify credit risks using numpy and pandas libraries predicting whether a given loan will be fully paid or not..  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
